## **Culture**

### **Agile software development**

describes a set of values and principles for software development under which requirements and solutions evolve through collaborative effort of self-organizing cross-functional teams. It advocates adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, and continuous improvement, and it encourages rapid and flexible response to change. Described in[ Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/). Read more:[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development)

### **DevOps**

represents a change in IT culture focusing on rapid IT service delivery through the adoption of agile, lean practices in the context of a system-oriented approach. DevOps emphasizes people \(and culture\) and seeks to improve collaboration between operations and development teams. DevOps implementations utilize technology — especially automation and monitoring tools that can leverage an increasingly programmable and dynamic infrastructure from a life cycle perspective. DevOps core principles are consistent with many of Site Reliability Engineering \(see: SRE\) principles and practices. One could view DevOps as a generalization of several core SRE principles to a wider range of organizations, management structures, and personnel. One could equivalently view SRE as a specific implementation of DevOps with some idiosyncratic extensions.

### **SRE \(Site Reliability Engineering\)**

is a discipline that incorporates aspects of software engineering and applies that to operations whose goals are to create ultra-scalable and highly reliable software systems. It encourages product reliability, accountability, and innovation. Read more: [Google](https://landing.google.com/sre/interview/ben-treynor.html)

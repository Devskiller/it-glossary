## **Roles**

### **Front-End Developer**

essentially creates whatever has a digital visual presence with which people interact \(client-side environment\). Traditionally, a front-end developer is a person who is comfortable with both design and coding; in other words someone who is comfortable using simple design tools and is able to create website using [HTML](http://www.computerhope.com/jargon/h/html.htm) code, style it using [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp) and make it interactive using JavaScript.

### **UI designer**

or“User Interface”designer,is the one that designs what the application looks like from the perspective of the user to enable users to interact with the application. UI designers must understand what front-end developer expects from him and know how to communicate with him, as well as have design skills.Often this person does not have to be a programmer at all.  

### **UX designer**

or“User Experience”designer is a person who helps create a better experience of using the application. This person simplifies the visual part of the application and brings out the features that are used most often. His/her job is to make the application as easy and useful for the users as possible to increase usability.

### **Back-End Developer**

is involved in the process of combining a server, an application and a database to solve a problem \(server-side environment\). This entire process is solidly entrenched in logic, a network of processes and queries being resolved in split seconds to give you a certain desired output as a user. They are different from front-end developers in that the job of a back-end developer is completely free of any visual design and relies on logical reasoning and software architecture that aims to deliver a particular output.

### **Full-Stack Developer**

is one who is comfortable working with both back-end and front-end technologies. A general knowledge of technologies from every section of the development process is necessary for a front-end developer. This of course means that they will not be an expert in any one particular field but can rather offer a better overview of applicational possibilities and capability of bridging the gap between how the system functions and how it looks and feels for the user.

### **MEAN developer**

is one who uses JavaScript software stack for building dynamic websites and web applications. MEAN stack developers are experts in using MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS \(or Angular\), and Node.js. Because all components of MEAN stack support programs written in JavaScript, MEAN applications can be written in one language for both server-side and client-side execution environments.

### **System administrator \(SysOp, sysadmin\)**

is a person who is responsible for the upkeep, configuration and reliable operation of computer systems, mostly servers. Read more:[ Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_administrator)

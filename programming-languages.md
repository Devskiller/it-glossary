## **Programming languages and technologies**

### **Java**

is a compiled, object-oriented programming language, similar in syntax to C++. It is intended to let application developers “write once, run anywhere” meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.

### **C**

is a general-purpose, imperative computer programming language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, while a static type system prevents many unintended operations. C was originally developed by Dennis Ritchie between 1969 and 1973 at Bell Labs, and used to reimplement the Unix operating system. It has since become one of the most widely used programming languages of all time. Read more:[ Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29)

### **C++**

\(pronounced cee plus plus /ˈsiː plʌs plʌs/\) is a general-purpose programming language. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features and it provides facilities for low-level memory manipulation. Read more:[ Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B)

### **C\#**

\(pronounced “C sharp”\) is a programming language that is designed for building a variety of applications that run on the .NET Framework. C\# is simple, powerful, type-safe, and object-oriented. Read more:[ Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_%28programming_language%29)

### **Python**

is one of the most commonly used programming languages \(top 3 according to [IEEE Spectrum research](https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/the-2017-top-programming-languages)\). It was first released in 1991 and gained popularity for being simple to learn, yet powerful in solving problems. The syntax is similar to C++ family yet equipped with a variety of modern solutions.

### **Visual Basic .NET**

is a multi-paradigm, object-oriented programming language implemented on the .NET Framework. Microsoft launched VB.NET in 2002 as the successor to its original Visual Basic language. Although the “.NET” portion of the name was dropped in 2005, “Visual Basic \[.NET\]” is used to refer to all Visual Basic languages releases since 2002 in order to distinguish between them and the classic Visual Basic. Along with Visual C\#, it is one of the two main languages targeting the .NET framework. Read more: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_.NET)

### **PHP**

\(recursive acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor\) is a widely-used open source general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for web development and can be embedded into HTML. Read more: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP)

### **JavaScript**

\(also known as JS\) is high-level, prototype-based, untyped, dynamic language. Depending on the environment JavaScript can be interpreted or compiled. It is a multi-paradigm programming language, supporting object-oriented, imperative and functional programming styles.

### **Perl**

was originally developed by Larry Wall in 1987 as a general-purpose Unix scripting language to make report processing easier. Since then, it has undergone many changes and revisions. Perl 6, which began as a redesign of Perl 5 in 2000, eventually evolved into a separate language. Both languages continue to be developed independently by different development teams and they liberally borrow ideas from one another. Read more:[ Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl)

### **Ruby**

is a dynamic, reflective, object-oriented, general-purpose programming language. It was designed and developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto in Japan. According to its creator, Ruby was influenced by Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp. Read more:[ Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_%28programming_language%29)

### **Swift**

is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm compiled programming language developed by Apple Inc. for iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and Linux. Read more:[ Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_%28programming_language%29)

### **R**

is an open source programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software and data analysis.Read more:[ Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_%28programming_language%29)

### **Go**

\(often referred to as golang\) is a free and open source programming language created at Google. Read more:[ Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%28programming_language%29)

### **Objective-C**

is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language that adds Smalltalk-style messaging to the C programming language. It wasthe main programming language used by Apple for the OS X and[iOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS)operating systems, and their respective application programming interfaces \(APIs\) Cocoa and Cocoa Touch prior to the introduction of Swift. Read more:[ Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C)

### **SQL**

is the most popular database programming language. Historically, this declarative programming paradigm has been a key feature for ad-hoc queries run for data introspection executed by human users directly with SQL \(rather than with a UI\). In modern days, SQL is also embedded in other, more general purpose programming languages like Java in order to access data from central databases.

### **Scala**

is a general-purpose programming language providing support for functional programming and a strong static type system. Designed to be concise, many of Scala’s design decisions aimed to address criticisms of Java. Read more:[ Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scala_%28programming_language%29)

### **Android**

is the world’s most popular operating system \(it’s not a programming language\) dedicated mainly to mobile devices. The source code is developed by Google under the Android Open Source Project \(AOSP\). Subsequent versions are usually released annually and are announced at Google I/O conferences.

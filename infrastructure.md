## **Infrastructure**

### **Infrastructure**

refers to the composite hardware, software, network resources and services required for the existence, operation and management of an enterprise IT environment. It allows an organization to deliver IT solutions and services to its employees, partners and/or customers and is usually internal to an organization and deployed within owned facilities.

### **Cloud service**

is any service made available to users on demand via the Internet from cloud computing provider’s servers \(i.g Microsoft Azure or Amazon Web Services\) as opposed to being provided from a physical on-premises servers.

### **Software as a Service \(SaaS\)**

sometimes referred to as “on-demand software”,is a software licensing and delivery model in which software is licensed on a subscription basis and is centrally hosted. SaaS is the most familiar form of cloud service for consumers. SaaS providers make the application available to users through the Internet, usually a browser-based interface. SaaS customers can enjoy the software without having to worry about development, maintenance, support, update, or backups. The downside, however, is that your software experience is wholly dependent on the SaaS provider, which is responsible for stability, reporting, billing, and security. SaaS examples: Gmail, Dropbox, Salesforce, or Netflix. Read more:[ Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service)

### **Platform as a Service \(PaaS\)**

is a category of cloud computing services.PaaS functions at a lower level than SaaS, typically providing a platform on which software can be developed and deployed. PaaS providers abstract much of the work of dealing with servers and give clients an environment in which the operating system and server software, as well as the underlying server hardware and network infrastructure are taken care of, leaving users free to focus on the business side of scalability, and the application development of their product or service.It allowscustomers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing and launching an app. PaaS makes the development, testing, and deployment of applications quick, simple, and cost-effective. PaaS examples: Pivotal Cloud Foundry, Heroku. Read more:[ Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service)

### **Infrastructure as a Service \(IaaS\)**

isthemost basic cloud-service model offering computing infrastructure – virtual machines and other resources – as a service to subscribers. It’s a lower level compared to PaaS. Typically, IaaS provides hardware, storage, servers and data center space or network components. It allows to quickly scale up and down with demand and pay only for what you use. This makes IaaS well-suited for workloads that are temporary, experimental or change unexpectedly. IaaS examples: Amazon Web Services and its EC2.

### **Automation**

IT automation is the linking of disparate systems and software in such a way that they become self-acting or self-regulating. Read more:[ TechTarget.com](http://searchitoperations.techtarget.com/definition/IT-automation)

### **Infrastructure as Code\(IaC\)**

also referred to asprogrammable infrastructure, means writing code \(which can be done using a high level language or any descriptive language\) to manage configurations and automate provisioning of infrastructure in addition to deployments. IaC is not only about writing scripts, it also involves using tested and proven software development practices that are already being used in application development, e.g. version control, testing, small deployments, use of design patterns etc. In short, this means you write code to provision and manage your server, in addition to automating processes. It’s an approach to managing IT infrastructure for the age of cloud, microservices and continuous delivery.

### **Containers**

consist of an entire runtime environment: an application, plus all its dependencies, libraries and other binaries, and configuration files needed to run it, bundled into one package. Containers are a solution to the problem of how to get software to run reliably when moved from one computing environment to another. This could be from a developer’s laptop to a test environment, from a staging environment into production, and perhaps from a physical machine in a data center to a virtual machine in private or public cloud.

### **Operating system**

is system software that manages computer hardware and [software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software) resources and provides common services for computer programs. All computer programs, excluding firmware, require an operating system to function. Examples: Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux. Read more: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system)

### **Shell**

is an interface that enables the user to interact with a computer. It provides user interface for access to an operating system’s services. In general, operating system shells use either command-line interface \(CLI\) or graphical user interface \(GUI\), depending on a computer’s role and particular operation. The name comes from the fact that shells are layers around the operating system kernel. Read more:[ Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_%28computing%29)

### **Metric**

measurement of a particular characteristic of a program’s performance or efficiency.

### **Log**

is a record of what has happened. Typically it helps diagnose problems or get certain insights on what is going on in an application’s life cycle.
